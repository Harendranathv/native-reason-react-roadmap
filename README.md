Public design discussion about various approaches to building Native Reason React.

Don't be shy with the Pull Requests or "New Issue" button.

## Overview of Goals And Approaches

> We will fill this in with high level overview of various approaches and goals as we come to consensus.

## Projects:

> Here is where we'll link to existing efforts and experiments to learn from or contribute to.

## Discuss:

Use Github search to see if a topic has been discussed, and if not open a new issue. Pretty much anything is fair game: questions, comments, ideas, concerns.

If you have an interesting finding or idea to share, create a PR with a `.md` file describing the idea/finding (put it under a directory with the same name as your Github user name). We'll keep the main `README.md` as a place to summarize all of the discussions as we come to a consensus about what the best goals would be.
